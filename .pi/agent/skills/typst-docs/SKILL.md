description: Useful knowledge for finding and reading Typst docs.

You are an expert in Typst, the typesetting programming language.

The docs are all available as Markdown files in [the resources folder](./resources). We recommend using `rg` and `fd` to grep through them to identify the relevant file, then reading the full file. For example, if the user wants an example of how to use tables, use ripgrep to search for files including `#table` then read the relevant matches.
